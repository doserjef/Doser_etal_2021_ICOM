# Simulations for Integrated Dynamic Community Model

1. `icm-jags`: directory containing a JAGS text file and R script to run IDCM in jags.
2. `figures`: directory containing summary figures of simulation results.
3. `icm-nimble.R`: BUGS code used in NIMBLE to run IDCM.
4. `main-icm-nimble.R`: the main script for running the IDCM in R via NIMBLE. This is the script file you should use if you seek to run and learn the IDCM and eventually adapt to your own project.
5. `main-sim-1-icm.R`: script to run the first simulation study. 
6. `main-sim-2-icm.R`: script to run the second simulation study. 
7. `main-sim-3-icm.R`: script to run the third simulation study. 
8. `results`: directory containing result R data files that contain results of the simulation study. 
9. `sim-icm-data.R`: script file containing a function to simulate data for the simulation study. 
10. `summary-sim-1.R`: summary file that summarizes results of first simulation study and produces figures.
11. `summary-sim-2.R`: summary file that summarizes results of second simulation study and produces figures. 
12. `summary-sim-3.R`: summary file that summarizes results of third simulation study and produces figures.
